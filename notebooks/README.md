# Notebooks

## Naming Rules
Notebooks are named according to this template:  
`{number}_{keyword}_{title}(_vXX).ipynb`  

---

Whenever a new notebook is created:

- If the notebook is a `report`, then it must be given a `number`
- If the notebook is either a `prototype` or `exploratory` it may be given a `number` if the contents represent a milestone in the overall story

Archived notebooks may have their number removed.

The available `keyword`s are shown in the table below.

| Keyword | Description |  |
|-|-|-|
| archive | This notebook is no longer useful in the current project scope.|  |
| exploratory | This notebook is dedicated to exploring data, iterating on an idea, or trying something new. |  |
| prototype | This notebook is a proof of concept for a new feature. Often applying a new idea directly to data. |  |
| report | This notebook pushes the state of the project forward. Often written as a tutorial that combines and explains the same features covered in exploratory and/or prototype notebooks. |  |

--- 

The `title` is the concise, descriptive title of the notebook.

Version information may be indicated after `title` as shown in the template above.
