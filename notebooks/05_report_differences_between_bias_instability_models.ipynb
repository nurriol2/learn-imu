        "# Differences Between Bias Instability Models\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal:  Determine which bias instability model best simulates bias instability.** \n",
        "\n",
        "We are interested in comparing three different models:\n",
        "- First Order Markov \n",
        "- MATLAB Model (or Filter Model)\n",
        "- Aceinna Model\n",
        "\n",
        "## First Order Markov\n",
        "We first saw the first order markov model in K. Jerath's Presentation *Noise Modeling of Sensors:  The Allan Variance Method*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each point $b$ in the simulated time series is calculated from an initial conditon $b_{0}$ according to $\\dot{b} = -\\frac{b}{T_{c}}+\\eta_{b}$. \n",
        "\n",
        "The appeal of the first order markov model is that **correlation time $T_{c}$** is explicitly defined in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## MATALB Model (or Filter Model)\n",
        "MATLAB implements bias instability through its `imuSensor` object. This model filters a white noise time series into 1/f noise - also known as bias instability.\n",
        "\n",
        "MATLAB is closed source, so it's not possible (right now) to inspect the code directly. However, K. Jerath implemented the same method in **[1](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64590-allan-variance-analysis-of-simulated-sensor-noise)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The drawback of this model is that correlation time is not explicitly used. However, the model consistently yields a PSD with the correct characteristics and can be used to accurately determine the bias instability coefficient from an Allan deviation plot. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Aceinna Model\n",
        "This model is an implementation of First Order Gauss-Markov model (discussed above). The exact equation used is derived in Section 3.2 of [Quinchia, et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812568/).\n",
        "\n",
        "This model computes a discrete bias instability time series according to:\n",
        "\n",
        "$x_{k} = (1-\\beta\\Delta t)x_{k-1} + \\sigma_{GM}\\sqrt{(1-e^{\\frac{-2\\Delta t}{T_{c}}})}w_{k}$\n",
        "\n",
        "We can rewrite this equation as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$x_{k}=(1-\\frac{1}{T_{c}}\\frac{1}{f_{s}})x_{k-1} + B \\sqrt{(1-e^{\\frac{-2}{f_{s}T_{c}}})}w_{k}$\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, it is natural to provide a bias coefficient $B$, a correlation time $T_{c}$, and sampling frequency $f_{s}$ to compute our bias instability time series. \n",
        "\n",
        "Note that $w{k}$ are samples from a standard normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Acienna model is explicitly implemented for 3 axis. We will have to be aware of this fact in the experiments below.\n",
